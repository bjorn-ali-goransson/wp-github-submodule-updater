Wordpress GitHub Submodule updater
===========================

If put in your themes folder (next to functions.php), and required from your functions.php, will create a "Update GitHub submodules" tool in admin menu (requires a .gitmodules file in your theme)

You can choose branch if more than one exists, but specific commits are not possible. Uses [http://developer.github.com/v3/ GitHub API v3].
